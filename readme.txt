INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:

If you do not wish to run this app locally feel free to visit:

https://student-success-tracker.herokuapp.com

Please note that this is a server not designed for production use and it sleeps when not in use.
Sometimes that means it can take awhile for the server to respond causing the MySQL connection to timeout.
Currently it has to be relaunched to fix that error.

The login information is as follows:

USERNAME: "tcss360"
PASSWORDL "Password"


For local use (And much more stable):
Install Node.js from: https://nodejs.org/en/download/

Direct your command line to the containing folder and type:

  npm install npm@latest -g
  npm install
  npm start
  
Type localhost:3000 insto your browser.
Use the above log in information to access the site both locally and on the webpage.
All instances of this webapp access the same database.
